TwitterSpy


Python is a very lightweight, but powerful language. This is my first script. It's fairly simple, with only one aim

It monitors a specified user's Twitter profile for tweets containing a specified string, and looks for tweets containing a link. Once a tweet with a matching string and url is found, it automatically opens the user's default browser and navigates to the url.
